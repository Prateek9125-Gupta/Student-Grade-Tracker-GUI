# Student-Grade-Tracker-GUI
This project is a graphical student grade tracking application built with Java Swing. It allows you to enter multiple students and subject-wise marks, then calculates and displays each student’s average, highest, lowest scores, and overall grade in a structured scrollable report window. It's a great beginner-to-intermediate level project for learning Java GUI development, loops, data structures (ArrayList), and event-driven logic.
